This entire package is a copy of vsjha/nsetools on github. I have fixed an issue where on android
phones, SSL_CERTIFICATE verification was failing. I dont see any commits to this repo after Feb 19,
hence getting this fix in seemed to be a problem. I have fixed this in my forked repo , but somehow
pip was not able to install this. As a last resort I have copied the source files and fixed this locally
without any prejudice to the original authors. I have raised a pull request for the same and once that is
merged , I can get rid of these local copies
